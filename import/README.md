# import - full scale data bundles from imported public projects

## About

This directory contains imported projects from GEO, ArrayExpress and 10x.

## Directory structure.

The top level directories represent the major import sources.  Underneath this it
is arranged into a directory per project.  The projects  from GEO all start with
GSE and are named after the GEO sample accessions.  Similarly the ArrayExpress all
start with E- and are ArrayExpress accessions.  The 10x projects are individually named.

Within each project directory you'll find metadata files downloaded from the original source,
and a  curated.tags file which was generated by data wranglers.

The data bundles are all in the gzipped tarball import.tgz.  This will unpack with
a directory structure mimicking this one, but then containing a bundle subdirectory
and multiples bundle1, bundle2, etc subsubdirectories for each project.  There's 
approximatedly 50,000 json files in import.tgz, which is too much for git really.
Since these are all generated automatically from the curated.tags files, no need to
track them individually anyway.

The manifest.json file will point to the real big data files.  These aren't reasonable
to check into git.  The files are to be found relative to the manifest.dir field, which
generally will be on a ftp or http or s3 bucket.
