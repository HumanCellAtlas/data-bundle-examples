# import - full scale data bundles from imported public projects

## About

This directory contains imported projects from GEO, ArrayExpress and 10x.

## Directory structure.

The top level directories represent the major import sources.  Underneath this it
is arranged into a directory per project.  The projects  from GEO all start with
GSE and are named aftet the GEO sample accessions.  Similarly the ArrayExpress all
start with E- and are ArrayExpress accessions.  The 10x projects are individually named.

Within each project directory you'll find metadata files downloaded from the original source,
a curated.tags file which was generated by data wranglers, and a bundle directory.
The bundle directory contains a subdirectory for each sample in the project.  The sample 
directories contain multiple json files which together describe the data bundle.

The manifest.json file will point to the real big data files.  These aren't reasonable
to check into git.  The files are to be found relative to the manifest.dir field, which
generally will be on a ftp or http or s3 bucket.
