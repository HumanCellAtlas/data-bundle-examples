Investigation Title	RNAseq of mouse POMC neurons
Comment[Submitted Name]	RNAseq of mouse POMC neurons
Experiment Description	From the arcuate nucleus of mice, we have dissociated neurons that express Proopiomelanocortin(POMC) and captured them on the Fluidigm C1 platform. These neuronsplay important roles in the regulation of appetite and sexual behavior. Here we propose tosequence RNA from 96 single POMC-expressing neurons to understand the variance in theirtranscriptomes.This data is part of a pre-publication release.
