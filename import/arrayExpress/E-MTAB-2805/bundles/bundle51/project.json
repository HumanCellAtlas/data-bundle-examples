We performed single cell RNA-Seq experiment on mESC that were stained with Hoechst 33342 and Flow cytometry sorted for G1, S and G2M stages of cell cycle. Single cell RNA-Seq was performed using Fluidigm C1 system and libraries were generated using Nextera XT (Illumina) kit.","supplementary_files":"ERCC_Sequences.txt","title":"Gene expression pattern of single mES cells during cell cycle stages","uuid":"8573819D-DDDE-4472-BADE-D3871027CB4D"}
