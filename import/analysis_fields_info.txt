This file describes the fields most important for analysis.  Most of them are in the assay
object, but there is an important one currently in sample.  

I'll describe each field starting with the number of times each value appears in the 17 public
project collection I've been curating.  Note that some projects will use more than one species or
method.  In general if a field is not relevant to a project it is omitted.

sample.donor.species has 20 uses with 2 vals
   13	Homo sapiens
   7	Mus musculus
This one I think is straightforward for this project.  The only controversy is whether it 
should also appear as assay.species.

assay.single_cell.method has 19 uses with 5 vals
   5	FACS
   5	mouth pipette
   5	Fluidigm C1
   2	drop-seq
   2	10x_v2
For drop-seq and 10x_v2, you can deduce most of the rest of the data from this field.
However there are whole other worlds out there.  Their is large variety of paired end and barcoding
techniques applied to FACS, Fluidigm C1, and yes, mouth pipette methods of single_cell isolation.
The "mouth pipette" may seem weird and low tech, but there is one data set in particular
that has over 2000 cells, and has both cell and UMI barcodes (8 bases each) using this
technique. This data set came in 2017.

assay.seq.umi_barcode_offset has 5 uses with 3 vals
   2	16
   2	12
   1	8
assay.seq.umi_barcode_read has 5 uses with 2 vals
   4	index
   1	read2
assay.seq.umi_barcode_size has 5 uses with 2 vals
   3	8
   2	10
You could also represent these as:
   10x_2  offset=16, size=10, read=index (aka 1)
   dropseq offset=12, size=8, read=index (aka 1)
   Chinese offset=8, size=8, read=read2
But I worry there is a lot more variation in the world than this one example from China

assay.single_cell.cell_barcode_offset has 5 uses with 1 vals
   5	0
assay.single_cell.cell_barcode_read has 5 uses with 2 vals
   4	index
   1	read2
assay.single_cell.cell_barcode_size has 5 uses with 3 vals
   2	16
   2	12
   1	8
You could also represent these as:
   10x_2  offset=0, size=16, read=index (aka 1)
   dropseq offset=0, size=12, read=index (aka 1)
   Chinese offset=0, size=8, read=read2


assay.seq.paired_ends has 17 uses with 3 vals
   7	no
   6	yes
   4	index1_reads2
There's an interdependence between what is in paired ends and assay.files[].type and
the barcode.read fields.  In particular

paired_ends = no
   files[].type = reads
paired_ends = yes
   files[].type = read1 or read2
paired_ends = index1_reads2
   files[].type = index or reads
