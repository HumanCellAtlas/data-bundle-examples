!Series_summary = Human fetal germ cells (FGCs) are precursors to sperm and eggs and are crucial for maintenance of the species. However, the developmental trajectories and heterogeneity of human FGCs remain largely unknown. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of over 2000 FGCs and their gonadal niche cells in female and male human embryos spanning several developmental stages. We found that the female FGCs undergo four distinct sequential phases characterized by mitosis, retinoic acid signaling, meiotic prophase, and oogenesis. Male FGCs develop through stages of migration, mitosis and cell cycle arrest. Individual embryos of both sexes simultaneously contain several subpopulations, highlighting the asynchronous and heterogeneous nature of FGC development. Moreover, we observed reciprocal signaling interactions between FGCs and their gonadal niche cells, including activation of BMP and Notch signaling pathways. Our work provides key insights into crucial features of human FGCs during their highly ordered mitotic, meiotic, and gametogenetic processes in vivo.
!Series_overall_design = Here we performed single cell RNA-seq analysis for 2,167 individual PGCs as well as their gonadal niche cells, covering the developmental stages from 4 to 26 weeks after gestation in both female and male human embryos

Biotinylated pre-indexed primer was used to amplify the PCR product by additional 4 cycles to introduce biotin tags to the 3’ end of the amplified cDNA. About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A modified Smart-seq2 protocol was applied for single-cell RNA-seq. Briefly, after MACS and FACS purification, a single PGC or gonadal somatic cell was picked into the lysis buffer by mouth pippete. The reverse transcription reaction was performed with 24 oligo (dT) primer anchored with the 8 bp cell specific barcode, and also with 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After the first-strand reaction, the cDNA was amplified by 17 cycles. Then the amplified cDNA of the PGCs of the same fetal sample were pooled together and the amplified cDNA of the gonadal somatic cells of the same fetal sample were pooled together to proceed the following steps. Biotinylated pre-indexed primer was used to amplify the PCR product by additional 4 cycles to introduce biotin tags to the 3’ end of the amplified cDNA. About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher). RNA seq library was constructed using Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapabiosystems) and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (sequenced by Novogene).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A modified Smart-seq2 protocol was applied for single-cell RNA-seq. Briefly, after MACS and FACS purification, a single PGC or gonadal somatic cell was picked into the lysis buffer by mouth pippete. The reverse transcription reaction was performed with 24 oligo (dT) primer anchored with the 8 bp cell specific barcode, and also with 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After the first-strand reaction, the cDNA was amplified by 17 cycles. Then the amplified cDNA of the PGCs of the same fetal sample were pooled together and the amplified cDNA of the gonadal somatic cells of the same fetal sample were pooled together to proceed the following steps. Biotinylated pre-indexed primer was used to amplify the PCR product by additional 4 cycles to introduce biotin tags to the 3’ end of the amplified cDNA. About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher). RNA seq library was constructed using Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapabiosystems) and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (sequenced by Novogene).

About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher). RNA seq library was constructed using Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapabiosystems) and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (sequenced by Novogene).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A modified Smart-seq2 protocol was applied for single-cell RNA-seq. Briefly, after MACS and FACS purification, a single PGC or gonadal somatic cell was picked into the lysis buffer by mouth pippete. The reverse transcription reaction was performed with 24 oligo (dT) primer anchored with the 8 bp cell specific barcode, and also with 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After the first-strand reaction, the cDNA was amplified by 17 cycles. Then the amplified cDNA of the PGCs of the same fetal sample were pooled together and the amplified cDNA of the gonadal somatic cells of the same fetal sample were pooled together to proceed the following steps. Biotinylated pre-indexed primer was used to amplify the PCR product by additional 4 cycles to introduce biotin tags to the 3’ end of the amplified cDNA. About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher). RNA seq library was constructed using Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapabiosystems) and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (sequenced by Novogene).

Subsequently, we also removed reads with adapter contaminants and low-quality bases (N>10%).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A modified Smart-seq2 protocol was applied for single-cell RNA-seq. Briefly, after MACS and FACS purification, a single PGC or gonadal somatic cell was picked into the lysis buffer by mouth pippete. The reverse transcription reaction was performed with 24 oligo (dT) primer anchored with the 8 bp cell specific barcode, and also with 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After the first-strand reaction, the cDNA was amplified by 17 cycles. Then the amplified cDNA of the PGCs of the same fetal sample were pooled together and the amplified cDNA of the gonadal somatic cells of the same fetal sample were pooled together to proceed the following steps. Biotinylated pre-indexed primer was used to amplify the PCR product by additional 4 cycles to introduce biotin tags to the 3’ end of the amplified cDNA. About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher). RNA seq library was constructed using Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapabiosystems) and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (sequenced by Novogene).

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = A modified Smart-seq2 protocol was applied for single-cell RNA-seq. Briefly, after MACS and FACS purification, a single PGC or gonadal somatic cell was picked into the lysis buffer by mouth pippete. The reverse transcription reaction was performed with 24 oligo (dT) primer anchored with the 8 bp cell specific barcode, and also with 8 bp unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = After the first-strand reaction, the cDNA was amplified by 17 cycles. Then the amplified cDNA of the PGCs of the same fetal sample were pooled together and the amplified cDNA of the gonadal somatic cells of the same fetal sample were pooled together to proceed the following steps. Biotinylated pre-indexed primer was used to amplify the PCR product by additional 4 cycles to introduce biotin tags to the 3’ end of the amplified cDNA. About 300 ng DNA was sheared to around 300 bp by Covaris S2 and the 3’ ternimal of the DNA was captured by Dynabeads® MyOne™ Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher). RNA seq library was constructed using Kapa Hyper Prep Kit (Kapabiosystems) and subjected to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (sequenced by Novogene).
!Sample_description = polyA RNA
!Sample_data_processing = Illumina CASAVA version 1.8 were used to the basecalling.
!Sample_data_processing = Raw reads were first organized by specific cell barcode information attached in the read 2 of pair-ended reads. Second, unique molecular identifier (UMI) information were added into the corresponding read 1 which were then trimmed to remove template switch oligo (TSO) sequence and polyA tails. Subsequently, we also removed reads with adapter contaminants and low-quality bases (N>10%).
!Sample_data_processing = Third, the cleaned reads were aligned to the hg19 human transcriptome (UCSC) using Tophat (version 2.0.12) (Trapnell et al., 2009). Fourth, uniquely mapped reads were counted using htseq-count of the HTSeq package and grouped by cell-specific barcode (Anders et al., 2014). Based on UMI information, duplicated transcripts of each gene were removed. Finally, within a given cell, distinct UMIs of each gene were counted as the transcript number of that gene.
!Sample_data_processing = The expression levels TPM, where TPM (transcript-per-million) was calculated by the number of UMIs of each gene divided by all the number of UMIs of a given cell, then multiplying by 1,000,000.
