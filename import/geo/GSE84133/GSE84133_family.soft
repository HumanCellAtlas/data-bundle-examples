!Series_summary = While the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures of cells. Here, we invoked inDrop, a droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq method, to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two strains of mice. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare ghrelin-expressing epsilon-cells, exocrine cell types, vascular cells, Schwann cells, quiescent and activated pancreatic stellate cells, and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles, and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta-cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER-stress. Finally, we deconvolve bulk gene expression samples using single-cell RNA-Seq to detect disease associated differential expression. Thus, our cross-species dataset provides a resource for the discovery of novel cell type-specific and cell type-restricted transcription factors, signaling receptors, and medically-relevant genes.

!Sample_characteristics_ch1 = strain: C57BL/6
!Sample_treatment_protocol_ch1 = Human pancreatic islets were obtained from Prodo or NDRI and recovered in CMRLS at 37°C for 24h-48h hours after receipt. Mouse islets were prepared using gradient centrifugation and islets from the same strain were pooled, then recovered in XX for 24h.
!Sample_molecule_ch1 = total RNA
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were encapsulated using the inDrop platform, into droplets on ice and lysed  in the 4nL microfluidic droplets using a final concentration of 0.4% NP-40. Single cell lysates were subject to reverse transcription at 50°C without purification of RNA (as previously described in Klein et al., Cell 2015).
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Cells were barcoded using the inDrop platform (Klein et al., Cell 2015), which makes use of the CEL-Seq protocol for library construction Hashimshony et al., Cell Reports 2012)
!Sample_data_processing = Reads were first filtered based on presence in read 1 of two sample barcode components separated by the W1 adaptor sequence (GAGTGATTGCTTGTGACGCCTT), as previously described (Klein et al., Cell 2015)
!Sample_data_processing = Read 2 was then trimmed using Trimomatic (5) (version 0.32; parameters: LEADING:28 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20  MINLEN:30).
!Sample_data_processing = Barcodes for each read were matched against a list of the pre-determined barcodes, and errors of up to two nucleotides mismatch were corrected. Reads with a barcode separated by more than two nucleotides from the reference list were discarded. The reads were then split into barcode-specific files for mapping and UMI filtering.
!Sample_data_processing = The trimmed reads were aligned using Bowtie (version 1.1.1, parameters: -n 1 -l 15 -e 80 -m 200 -best -strata -a) to the human or mouse transcriptome. The reference transcriptome was built using annotations from ENSEMBL (Homo sapiens: GRCh38.82,  Mus musculus: GRCm38.84) including all annotations with "Transcript Support Levels" of 1, 2, or NA (only accepted for protein coding genes).
!Sample_data_processing = A custom Python and PySAM script to process mapped reads into counts of UMI-filtered transcripts per gene, as previously described (Klein et al., Cell 2015)
!Sample_data_processing = Genome_build: GRCh38 (human sample), GRCm38 (mouse samples)
!Sample_data_processing = Supplementary_files_format_and_content: Columns = gene; rows = cells. Column 1 contains cell identifier. Column 2 contains matching cell barcode. Column 3 contains cell-type assignment for analysis. Columns 4+ contain counts for each gene. Values show unique molecular identifier (UMI)-filtered counts per cell detected in the raw data. No normalization is performed.
