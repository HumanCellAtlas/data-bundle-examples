Briefly, short sequencing reads were aligned to the UCSC hg19 transcriptome and were also used as input in RSEM v 1.2.1 to quantify gene expression levels (transcripts per million; TPM) for all UCSC hg19 genes in all samples.","We filtered out cells from our dataset where we detected less than 1,000 unique genes per cell. All genes that were not detected in at least 1% of all our single cells were discarded, leaving 20,869 genes for all further analyses. Data were log transformed (log TPM+1) for all downstream analyses.","Genome_build: hg19","Supplementary_files_format_and_content: matrix of gene expression estimates across good quality samples"],"donor":{"ncbi_taxon":"9606","species":"Homo sapiens","life_stage":"adult"},"protocols":[{"description":"cDNA from each sample was prepared using the SMART-Seq 2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2013).","type":"nucleic acid library construction protocol"}],"last_update_date":"2016-11-15","submission_date":"2016-10-27","culture_type":"none","body_part":{"organ":"blood","name":"blood dendritic cells"},"long_label":"CD141+ primary human conventional dendritic cells (CD141+ cDCs)","short_label":"CD141+ cDCs","geo_sample":"GSM2361591","ncbi_biosample":"SAMN05946166","supplementary_files":"ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByExp/sra/SRX/SRX227/SRX2271737"}
