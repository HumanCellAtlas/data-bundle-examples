!Series_summary = We report the single-cell RNA-seq based identification of 6 known human islet cell types (alpha cells, beta cells, delta cells, pp cells, acinar cells and duct cells) based on the expression of known marker genes. We further assess cell type specific gene expression and suggest novel marker genes for several cell types.
